******Graphing Calculator V2******

The advanced version of the Graphing Calculator, rebuilt for a faster, more interactive experience. V2 introduces real-time plotting, keyboard input, zoom controls, a customizable domain, and graph history.

üìù **Description**

Graphing Calculator V2 enhances the user experience by providing instant visual feedback. As you type a function, the graph updates in real-time. This version allows for finer control over the visualization, with features to zoom, set a custom domain for x, and access previously plotted functions. Like its predecessor, it also calculates and displays the function's roots.

‚ú® **Features**

Real-time Dynamic Plotting: The graph updates instantly as you type the function. No need to press a button!
Direct Keyboard Input: Type the function f(x) directly into an input field for faster workflow.
Customizable Domain: Easily set the minimum and maximum values for the x-axis to focus on a specific interval.
Zoom Functionality: Zoom in and out of the graph to inspect function behavior at different scales.
Graph History: Stores a history of your previously plotted functions, allowing you to recall and re-plot them with a single click.
Root Finding: Automatically calculates and displays the roots of the function within the visible domain.
Enhanced UI: An improved and more responsive user interface.

üöÄ **Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need the following libraries:
matplotlib
numpy

**Installation & Running**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/raghav-mehra/Graphing-Calculator-V2
cd Graphing-Calculator-V2


**Install the required packages:**

pip install matplotlib numpy


**Run the application:**

python Graphing_Calculator.py


**Usage**

Launch the application.
Begin typing a function f(x) into the input field. The graph will appear and update automatically.
Use the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons to adjust the view.
Specify the range of the x-axis in the Domain input fields.
Click on an entry in the History panel to instantly re-plot a previous function.
The calculated roots are displayed on the screen.

üí° Future Improvements (for V3 and beyond)

Calculus Tools: Add buttons to plot derivatives and integrals of functions.
3D Plotting: Extend functionality to plot functions with two variables (f(x, y)).
Save/Export: Add functionality to save the graph as an image file (e.g., PNG, JPG).
